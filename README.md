# World Happiness Report

## Introduction:

Utilizing the dataset from the World Happiness Report up to 2023, an in-depth examination is conducted on the factors contributing to happiness and well-being across various nations. This dataset, pivotal for providing key insights, stands as a fundamental resource for policymakers, researchers, and individuals eager to understand the complex dynamics of global happiness.

## Objective:

The core objective of this analysis is to illuminate the relationship between overall happiness and a set of variables, which include GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. This investigation is critical for discerning how these elements interact to influence the happiness index in diverse countries and regions. 

The analysis was conducted by addressing the following 8 business questions:

● What is the average happiness score across all countries? How do happiness scores vary across different regions or continents?

● Is there a correlation between social support and generosity? How does the generosity metric align with the overall happiness of a country?

● How have happiness scores changed over different years? Are there notable trends in perceptions of corruption over time?

● Compare the perception of corruption in European countries to that in Asian countries.

● Calculate the average happiness score for each region, considering only countries with a GDP per capita above the global average.

● Rank countries within each region based on their healthy life expectancy.

● Identify the top 5 countries with the highest GDP per capita. How does this affect their freedom to make life choices?

● Identify the country and region with the highest and lowest generosity metric over the past 3 years.
