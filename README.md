### Introduction:

Utilizing the dataset from the World Happiness Report up to 2023, an in-depth examination is conducted on the factors contributing to happiness and well-being across various nations. This dataset, pivotal for providing key insights, stands as a fundamental resource for policymakers, researchers, and individuals eager to understand the complex dynamics of global happiness.

### Objective:

The core objective of this analysis is to illuminate the relationship between overall happiness and a set of variables, which include GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. This investigation is critical for discerning how these elements interact to influence the happiness index in diverse countries and regions. 

The analysis was conducted by addressing the following 8 business questions:

● How do happiness scores vary across different regions or continents?

● What is the average happiness score across all countries? 

● How have happiness scores changed over different years?

● Compare the perception of corruption in European countries to that in Asian countries.

● Identify the top 5 countries with the most significant decline in generosity over the years.

● Find the top 3 countries with the most consistent improvement in healthy life expectancy over the years.

● What is the average freedom to make life choices in countries with above-average social support?

● Identify countries that have moved above the global average happiness score over the years.
